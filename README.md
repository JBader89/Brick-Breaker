Brick-Breaker
=============

This was a project I created for my own pleasure and personal training while I was abroad in Hong Kong.

The idea behind it was to create a multi-level brick breaker game that featured some interesting rules and power-ups.

The project was written entirely in Flash ActionScript 3.0, complete with 20 levels, a myriad of different user power-ups, and sound effects.

To play, click the spacebar to start, and use the arrow keys to move left and right. Enjoy!
